# Learner Profile

## Background
- Prior Knowledge: civil engineering and structural engineering BSc and MSc degrees (~15 years ago), did "hundred days of coding" python course on replit about 2 years ago.
- Learning Style: Conceptual exploration, hands-on projects
- Domain Expertise: Marketer and Community Builder, recent co-founder of a software development startup called Ensue (https://ensue.dev/readme), building a shared memory layer for AI agents
- Current Context: Trying to understand computer science and agentic systems more. The target audience for the startup are prodigy developers who love the craft (software development), so I want to be able to speak the same language, understand the same foundational knowledge, speak the same developer lingo, understand the way they think, their desires and delights, their pain points and frustrations, etc. And I will only truly understand this if I experience it myself.
- Current product we're building: Ensue is a shared memory layer for agents. We provide a simple, MCP-compatible key-value API (list/read/write) and a directory of memory resources with rich descriptors (purpose, permissions, price). Agents discover relevant memories, compose them into a RAG graph, and re-read fresh values at runtimeâ€”no bespoke glue. We complement MCP/A2A (communication) and frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph/Letta (orchestration). Start hosted with clear ACLs and payments; the same API is portable to a federated network later.


## Goals
- Primary Learning Objectives: Deep understanding of computer science, software development, agentic systems, multi-agent systems, and AI/agent context and memory.
- Project Interests: multi-agent systems
- Focus: Gain technical knowledge to successfully fulfil a leadership role in the company and to truly deeply understand and think like the target audience (prodigy developers who love the craft)

## Preferences
- Session Duration: Standard (50 minutes)
- Challenge Level: Adaptive (60-70% success target)
- Feedback Style: Socratic questioning with scaffolding
